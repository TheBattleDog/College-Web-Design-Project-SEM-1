                <hr class="h2-u">
                <p>Alappuzha is a city in Kerala, India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Alappuzha
                    district.
                    Alappuzha is considered as the oldest planned city in the region. It is one of the most popular
                    tourist
                    attractions in Kerala. The city is located in the coastal region of Laccadive Sea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Situated on the south-western coast of India, Alappuzha is also known by its anglicized name
                    Alleppey. Gifted with immense natural beauty, Alappuzha’s backwaters have been the mainstay of
                    Kerala’s tourism. Alappuzha port used to be one of the busiest trade centers and traded with the
                    Persian Gulf regions and even Europe. Close to Alappuzha lies Kuttanad, the ‘Granary of Kerala’,
                    where farming is done below sea level.

                <p>
                    In early 20th Century, the then British Viceroy Lord Curzon, while visiting Alappuzha, was
                    fascinated by its scenic beauty and declared it as the Venice of the East. Alappuzha, whose
                    foundations were laid by Travancore’s Dewan Raja Kesava Das in the second half of 18th century, had
                    trade relations with ancient Greece and Rome. Even travelers like Pliny and Ptolemy have mentioned
                    about places in Alappuzha in their works. It was because of the efforts and foresight of Raja Kesava
                    Das, who constructed roads and canals to improve transportation, that Alappuzha became a premier
                    port town.
